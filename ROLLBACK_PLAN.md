# üîÑ ROLLBACK PLAN - Emergency Deployment Recovery

## üö® When to Execute Rollback

Execute this plan if:
- Azure deployment fails after 30+ minutes
- Smoke tests continue to fail after deployment completion  
- Production site becomes unresponsive
- Critical functionality is broken
- User-reported issues indicate deployment problems

---

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK PROCEDURE

### Step 1: Git Rollback (2 minutes)
```bash
cd C:\Users\Acid Acct1\Documents\Cash_Flow_APP\AcitechAppServ

# Revert the migration commit
git revert ffbfa50 --no-edit

# Push rollback to trigger Azure redeployment
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Verify Rollback (5-10 minutes)  
```bash
# Wait for Azure deployment
# Expected: Returns to previous Tailwind version

# Test critical routes
curl -I https://app.acidtech.fintraqx.com/
curl -I https://app.acidtech.fintraqx.com/dashboard
curl -I https://app.acidtech.fintraqx.com/data-import
```

### Step 3: Validate Previous Version (2 minutes)
```bash
# Confirm old version is working
BASE_URL=https://app.acidtech.fintraqx.com curl -s https://app.acidtech.fintraqx.com/dashboard | grep -i "tailwind"
# Should return: Tailwind references found (expected for rollback)
```

### Immediate (within 1 hour):
1. **Notify Stakeholders**: Inform team of rollback
2. **Monitor Logs**: Check Azure Application Insights
3. **User Communication**: Update status if needed
4. **Issue Documentation**: Create incident report

### Short-term (within 24 hours):
1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigate deployment failure
