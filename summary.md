# Summary

## Problem we had
Flask app in debug mode and outdated Plotly script causing console warning, security risk

## What we changed
- Disabled debug mode and enforced secure startup configuration
- Ensured SECRET_KEY and database configuration load from environment variables
- Enforced gunicorn startup `gunicorn --bind=0.0.0.0 --timeout 600 wsgi:app`
- Replaced deprecated Plotly reference with version 2.27.0 and loaded it only on pages needing charts

## Current status
Ready for production with secure startup and up-to-date charting library

## Next steps
- Deployment testing on Azure
- Logging verification
